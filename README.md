## Description
This application is a backend for an Internet retail company's e-commerce website. The server runs with Node and an Express API to use Sequelize and interact with a MySQL database. The app uses the Express, MySQL2, Sequelize, and dotenv packages. It synchronizes Sequelize models to a MySQL database upon server startup.
